# Amazon Prime Video Data Analysis Dashboard

## üåç An Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Prime Dataset

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Amazon Prime Video's content catalog. The analysis includes metrics such as content distribution by genre, ratings, release year, and content type (Movies vs. TV Shows). The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, and the analysis was performed using Python, Power BI, and supporting libraries.

## üîç Project Overview

The goal of this project is to present a visually compelling and informative dashboard that captures key insights about Amazon Prime Video's library. This project showcases my skills in data extraction, data cleaning, and data visualization, with the final dashboard developed in Power BI.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Key Features of the Dashboard

1. **Ratings Distribution**: Analysis of shows and movies by their assigned ratings, highlighting the most common rating categories.
2. **Genre Breakdown**: Visualization of content distribution across various genres, with Drama, Comedy, and Suspense being among the top genres.
3. **Content Release Year**: Breakdown of movies and TV shows released each year, emphasizing trends in content availability over time.
4. **Content Type Distribution**: A pie chart showing the proportion of movies vs. TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.
5. **Country and Genre Filters**: Interactive filters for exploring content by release year, genre, type, and country.

## üõ† Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data extraction and cleaning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For initial data analysis and documentating.
- **VS Code**: As the main coding environment.
- **Power BI**: For creating the final interactive dashboard.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project sharing.

## üíæ Abour Dataset
Amazon Prime is another one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have close to 10000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally.
